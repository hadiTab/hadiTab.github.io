# Welcome

My name is Hadi Tabatabaee. I use this blog to explore topics on software development, robotics, autonomous vehicles, machine learning, and other topics I'm passionate about.

I work as a software engineer at [LG Silicon Valley Lab](http://lgsvl.com) on autonomous vehicles. Before this, I was developing software for inventory management robots at [Fellow Robots](https://www.fellowrobots.com).
